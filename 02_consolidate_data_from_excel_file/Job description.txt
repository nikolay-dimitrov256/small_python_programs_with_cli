Need to create a python script that will do the following; 
 
1) find XLSX in local directory - same as python script - must run on Windows 
2) Find data in Sheets; NORAM, LATAM, EMEA, APAC, Columns A through C. 
Where a row has data in columns A through C, find the value in two rows below (planned orders) in find the value in columns E through T.   
3) Copy the value and corresponding month from above column to sheet Data as a new row.   
4) Add the year from row 1 above the cell with month data and to column "Year" in the new sheet. 
5) Where a row has data in columns A through C, copy the data from column V to column "notes" in the new sheet. 
6) Repeat for each instance of  a cell found with data in columns E through T. 
7) Do not copy data if the value is 0 
8) Export to XLSX file in local directory using source XLSX file name + "consolidated_%date%" 
9) Log output to log.txt  in local directory 
 
Source file = Forecast_30NOV23.xlsx 
Desired Output = consolidated_planned_orders_with_exclusions.xlsx
